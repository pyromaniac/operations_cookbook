In this GIT book I'll try to reflect my experience and knowledge as a collection of recepies and approaches that everyone is free to follow in their applications. The goal is to make the Rails application world a bit better and more unified place.

Ruby on Rails framework did a great job for application unification. Using Rails means that anyone with Rails experience can come to the project and know right away where to look in order to proceed with the project's evolution.

Ruby on Rails is a great framework to kick-start whatever project but when your project grows it becomes more and more difficult to support and modify code written in the rails way. Models coupled with the domain logic getting possessed with nomeruous contradicting callbacks, conditional validation, virtual fields and domain logic.

It is a time to separate the concerns. While it is difficult to do in an existing application, it is not impossible. The process might be slow thought (depending on the amount of resources) and the idea is to make the target goal clear to all the participants by using a framework.
